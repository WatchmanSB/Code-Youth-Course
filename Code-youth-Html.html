    <h1>Hello, My name is Steven Belenchia</h1>
    <h2>February-26-1995</h2>

    <p>I joined the Code-Youth program because I heard many good things about it from a friend of mine who took the course prior to the one we are currently attending. Coding has always been an interest to me and I have always been interested in how programs work and how video games function. In todays day and age, coding is an intregal part of our society. From communications to Trade. from your daily entertainment and needs to the basic everyday functions of a company, coding is interwoven with almost every aspect of our life.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the things I hope to learn from this class is </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn Html, CSS, Java</li>
        <li>Find a career through the knowledge I leann in this course</li>
        <li>Help others learn and understand coding</li>
        <li>Gain a sense of accomplishment for learning a difficult skill</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My interest vary from a wide variety of subjects and skills.
        <ul>
            <li>Gardening</li>
            <li>working with clay</li>
            <li>Off grid living</li>
            <li>DIY projects</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>But recently (1.5 years ago) I became infatuated with Gamestop. The company? Yes, the Company. But most importantly its new Chairman <a>Ryan Cohen</a>, the massive move from a brick and mortar store to a technology driven company, and its breakthrough into the decentralised crypto market place and crypto wallet. 
    But most importantly the fact that Gamestop, the company, has been massively <a>Shorted</a> by large instituational hedge funds who have overleveraged themselves to a point of no return. </p>
    The knowledge I have gained from <a>independant researchers</a> to <a>Industry professionals</a>. From the knowledge that I have learned about the financial markets, to the crime I have witnessed being commited by the mainstream media, political figures, and Owners of billion dollar hedge funds, I can safely assume that within the coming months to next year, we will expeience a collapse of the entire world financial markets.</p>
