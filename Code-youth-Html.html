    <h1>Hello, My name is Steven Belenchia</h1>
    <h2>February-26-1995</h2>

    <p>I joined the Code-Youth program because I heard many good things about it from a friend of mine who took the course prior to the one we are currently attending. Coding has always been an interest to me and I have always been interested in how programs work and how video games function. In todays day and age, coding is an intregal part of our society. From communications to Trade. from your daily entertainment and needs to the basic everyday functions of a company, coding is interwoven with almost every aspect of our life.</p>
