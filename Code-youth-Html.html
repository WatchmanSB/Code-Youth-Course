    <h1>Hello, My name is Steven</h1>
    
    <h2>The reason why I joined Code-Youth</h2>
    <p>I joined the Code-Youth program because I heard many good things about it from a friend of mine who took the course prior to the one we are currently attending. Coding has always been an interest to me and I have always been intreged in how programs work and how video games function. In todays world, coding is an intregal part of our society. From communications to Trade, to your daily entertainment and needs to the basic everyday functions of a company. Coding isthe fundemental backbone of our technology drivin society, interwoven with almost every aspect of our life.</p>

    <p>However, recently within the past 1.5 years I became infatuated with Gamestop. The company? Yes, the Company. But most importantly its new Chairman <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ryan+cohen&rlz=1C1VDKB_enCA969CA969&oq=ryan+cohen&aqs=chrome..69i57j46i433i512j0i433i512j0i512l7.1480j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Ryan Cohen</a>, the massive move from a brick and mortar store to a <a href="https://nft.gamestop.com/">Fintech company</a>, and its breakthrough into the <a href="https://wallet.gamestop.com/">decentralised crypto market place and crypto wallet</a>. 
    But most importantly the fact that Gamestop, the company, has been massively <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/r8bf31/naked_shorts_hiding_in_plain_sight_basic_math/">Shorted</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7fsqc/where_and_how_citadelother_hedge_funds_have_been/">large instituational hedge funds who have overleveraged themselves to a point of no return.</a> </p>
    The knowledge I have gained from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/">independant researchers</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Superstonk/videos">Industry professionals</a>. From the knowledge that I have learned about the financial markets, to the crime I have witnessed being commited by the mainstream media, political figures, and Owners of billion dollar hedge funds, I can safely assume that within the coming months to next year, we will expeience a collapse of the entire world financial markets. Many will be harmed worse 2008, and believed by every independant researcher, worse than the great depression. The only way to overcome the coming economic disatster is to hedge against it. It only there was a stock that had that potential....</p>

    <p>No, none of this is a joke. The term "meme stock" does not have any real meaning. Very hard times are coming in the near future and there is truly only one way to financially secure yourself.
        That is of course, if you are willing to give the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/">independant reseachers</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Superstonk/videos">Industry professionals</a> who have peer reviewed and verified what we have been saying for 1 and a half years. then you may just have made one of the best <a href="https://gmefloor.com/">decisions of your life</a>, when their risk is quite literally <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=How+high+can+a+short+squeeze+go%3F&rlz=1C1VDKB_enCA969CA969&oq=How+high+can+a+short+squeeze+go%3F&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l8j0i390.12768j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">infinity</a> </p>
